# SMCI-Calculations

This code analyzes soil moisture dynamics in Pakistan using NASA's SMAP data to compute the Soil Moisture Condition Index (SMCI), a measure of drought and wetness. It visualizes SMCI on a vibrant map, highlighting dry (red), moderate (yellow), and wet (green) areas across the country. The code also includes a detailed legend and exports the results as a GeoTIFF for further analysis. A powerful tool for environmental monitoring, it inspires actionable insights for sustainable water and land management.
